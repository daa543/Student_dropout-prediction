# Student_dropout-prediction

This project is focused on predicting student dropout rates by utilizing various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes features that capture both academic and personal information about the students.

The target variable classifies students into one of three categories: those who have dropped out, those who have graduated, and those who are still enrolled. By analyzing these features, the project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately identify students at risk of dropping out, providing valuable insights for educational institutions to improve student retention.
